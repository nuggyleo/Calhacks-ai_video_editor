# This file is for cutting-edge generative AI features.
# It will interface with models that can create new content from text prompts,
# such as text-to-speech for voiceovers or text-to-video for B-roll footage.
#
# Potential Functions:
# - `generate_voiceover(text: str, voice_style: str) -> Path`:
#   Uses a Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to create an audio file from text.
#
# - `generate_b_roll_clip(prompt: str, duration_seconds: int) -> Path`:
#   Uses a Text-to-Video generation model/API to create a short video clip.
#
# These functions will enable highly creative, AI-driven video production.
