# This file will leverage computer vision models to analyze video content.
# Its main function is to detect scene changes within a video clip, providing
# a list of start and end timestamps for each distinct scene.
#
# Core Logic:
# 1. Use a library like `PySceneDetect` or a custom OpenCV implementation.
# 2. Analyze the video frame by frame, looking for significant changes in content
#    or color histograms, which indicate a scene cut.
# 3. Return a list of scenes, e.g., `[{ "scene": 1, "start": "00:00:00", "end": "00:00:23" }, ...]`.
#
# This allows users to perform high-level edits like "remove the third scene" or "rearrange the scenes".
