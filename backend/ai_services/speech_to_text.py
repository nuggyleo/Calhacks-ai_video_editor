# This file will contain functions that interact with speech-to-text AI models.
# Its primary purpose is to take a video or audio file and return a structured
# subtitle file (e.g., SRT format) with text and timestamps.
#
# Core Logic:
# 1. Extract the audio stream from the input video file.
# 2. Send the audio data to a transcription service (e.g., OpenAI's Whisper API).
# 3. Receive the transcription result, which may include word-level timestamps.
# 4. Format the result into a standard subtitle format.
#
# This enables features like automatic subtitle generation.
