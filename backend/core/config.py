# This file will contain all configuration settings for the backend application.
# By centralizing configuration, we can easily manage settings for different
# environments (development, testing, production).
#
# Examples of what will go here:
# - API keys for services like OpenAI
# - Database connection strings
# - Redis URL for Celery
# - Paths for temporary file storage
#
# We will use Pydantic's BaseSettings to load variables from environment variables
# or a .env file, which is a best practice for security and flexibility.

pass # Placeholder to make the file valid Python
