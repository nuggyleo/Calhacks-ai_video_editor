# This file is responsible for setting up and configuring the Celery application instance.
# Celery is our distributed task queue. It allows us to run time-consuming
# video processing tasks in the background, separate from the main API process.
#
# Key Setup Steps:
# 1. Initialize the Celery app.
# 2. Configure it with a "broker" URL (we'll use Redis) so it knows where to
#    send and receive messages (tasks).
# 3. Set up a "backend" URL (also Redis) to store the results and statuses of tasks.
# 4. Autodiscover all task functions defined in our application (e.g., in `video_tasks.py`).
