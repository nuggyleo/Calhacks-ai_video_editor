# This file will contain the definitions of our Celery tasks.
# Each public function in this file will be a "task" that can be executed
# asynchronously by a Celery worker.
#
# These tasks are the bridge between the API/NLP layer and the video processing engine.
#
# Example Task Structure:
# @celery_app.task
# def process_video_trim(command_json: dict):
#     # 1. Parse the input JSON to get file paths, start/end times, etc.
#     # 2. Call the corresponding function from `video_engine.operations`.
#     #    e.g., operations.trim_video(...)
#     # 3. Handle success or failure, and update the task's state.
#     # 4. Return the path to the resulting video file.

# @celery_app.task
# def export_video(source_file_id: str, export_profile: str):
#     """
#     A new task specifically for handling the slow export/compression process.
#     """
#     # 1. Look up the actual file path from the source_file_id.
#     # 2. Generate an output path for the final exported video.
#     # 3. Call the appropriate function from `video_engine.export` based on the
#     #    `export_profile` (e.g., 'web', 'hd1080').
#     #    e.g., export.export_for_web(input_path, output_path)
#     # 4. Return the public URL or path of the compressed video.
