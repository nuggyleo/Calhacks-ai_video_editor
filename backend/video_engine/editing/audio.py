# This file will focus on advanced audio manipulation within a video project.
# It will handle tasks beyond simply adding a background track, such as
# noise reduction, volume automation, and audio mixing.
#
# These functions will use FFmpeg's powerful audio filters.
#
# Example Functions:
# - `reduce_noise(input_path: str, output_path: str)`:
#   Applies a noise reduction filter to the audio track.
#
# - `duck_audio(main_track_path: str, duck_track_path: str, output_path: str)`:
#   Lowers the volume of the `duck_track` (e.g., music) whenever there is
#   audio in the `main_track` (e.g., dialogue). This is known as "audio ducking".
