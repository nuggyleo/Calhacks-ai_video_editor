# This file will extend our video processing capabilities with visual effects.
# It will contain functions for applying filters, transitions, and other
# stylistic adjustments to video clips.
#
# These functions will build upon the base `ffmpeg-python` operations.
#
# Example Functions:
# - `apply_filter(input_path: str, output_path: str, filter_name: str)`:
#   Applies a named filter like 'grayscale', 'sepia', or 'vignette'.
#
# - `add_transition(clip1_path: str, clip2_path: str, output_path: str, transition_type: str)`:
#   Creates a transition (e.g., 'fade', 'wipe') between two video clips.
