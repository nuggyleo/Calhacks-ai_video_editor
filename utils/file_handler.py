# This utility file will provide helper functions for file system operations.
# It will abstract away the logic for handling uploads, creating temporary
# directories, and generating safe file paths. This keeps our API endpoints cleaner.
#
# Potential Functions:
# - `save_uploaded_file(upload_file: UploadFile, session_id: str) -> Path`:
#   Saves an uploaded file to a session-specific directory and returns its path.
#
# - `get_output_path(session_id: str, extension: str) -> Path`:
#   Generates a unique and safe path for a new output file.
#
# - `cleanup_session_files(session_id: str)`:
#   Deletes all files and directories associated with a user's session.
