# This file is the core of our video processing capabilities.
# It will contain a set of functions, each responsible for a specific
# video editing operation (e.g., trimming, concatenating, adding audio).
#
# These functions will act as a clean, Python-native wrapper around the powerful
# but complex FFmpeg command-line tool. We will use the `ffmpeg-python` library
# to build FFmpeg commands programmatically and safely.
#
# Example Functions:
# - `trim(input_path: str, output_path: str, start: str, end: str)`
# - `concatenate(video_paths: list[str], output_path: str)`
# - `add_audio(video_path: str, audio_path: str, output_path: str)`
#
# Each function will take file paths and parameters, execute the FFmpeg command,
# and wait for it to complete.
